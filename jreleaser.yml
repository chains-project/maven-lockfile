  description: A plugin to lock and validate the integrity of the dependencies of a maven based project.
  longDescription: This plugin is a proof of concept for a maven plugin that can be used to validate
        the integrity of a maven repository. It does this by generating a lock file that contains
        the checksums of all the artifacts in the repository. The lock file can then be used to
        validate the integrity of the repository. This guards the supply chain against malicious
        actors that might tamper with the artifacts in the repository.
