# Contributing to Maven-Lockfile

ðŸŽ‰ First thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

In the interest of making the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved, we have a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Code-Style:

We use Qodana to check the code-style. It is more or less IntelliJ headless with a costum rule set. These rules a defined in the `qodana.yml` file. Don't worry if you don't have Qodana installed. The CI will check your code and give you feedback. This is only feedback and not a hard rule. If you think the rule is wrong, please open an issue and we will discuss it.

For the code formatting, we use spotless. You can invoke `mvn spotless:apply` to format your code. If you use IntelliJ, you can install the spotless plugin, and it will format your code on save.


## Commit-Message-Style:

We use gitmoji to define the type of the commit. You can find a list of all gitmojis [here](https://gitmoji.dev/). Please use the gitmoji in the commit message. If you are unsure what to use no worries, I will help you.

## Pull Request Process

We don't require you to open an issue before you open a PR. But if you want to discuss something, please open an issue first. This will help us to keep track of the changes and to discuss them. If you open a PR without an issue, please add a description to the PR. This will help us to understand what you would like to change.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue. Please add as much information as possible. This will help us to fix the bug as fast as possible. If you would like to fix the bug yourself, please open an issue first. This will help us to keep track of the changes and to discuss them.

## Updating doc

We template our README.md file. If you would like to update the README.md file, please update the template file. The template file is located in the `template` folder. The README.md file is generated by the `mvn resources:copy-resources` command. Please don't update the README.md file directly.


Don't be scared to ask questions. We are happy to help you.

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you again for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰
